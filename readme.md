# findCorrelation
- A Python equivalent for the `findCorrelation` function from the `R` language.

- Among other possible implementation differences from the `R` version, this function takes a Pandas dataframe and calculates a correlation matrix, instead of taking a correlation matrix directly as input.

- Note: this function uses `numpy` and `pandas` libraries.
