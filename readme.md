# findCorrelation
- A Python equivalent for the `findCorrelation` function from the `R` language.

- Different from the `R` version, this function takes a Pandas dataframe and calculates a correlation matrix, instead of taking a correlation matrix directly as input. This was chosen to better acommodate named columns along with a numpy implementation (which is faster). 

- There may be implementation differences relative to the `R` version

- Note: this function uses `numpy` and `pandas` libraries.
